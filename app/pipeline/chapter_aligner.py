# Changes from upstream, confined to the bottom of this file:
#   - achew's `BasicChapter`/`DetectedCue` are normally Pydantic models
#     imported from its own web-API and reference-model layers
#     (app.api.routes.chapters / app.models.chapter), which this project
#     doesn't depend on. They're reproduced here as minimal plain
#     dataclasses carrying only the fields ChapterAligner actually reads
#     (title/timestamp/gap) plus DetectedCue.from_silences(), achew's own
#     silence -> cue conversion (api/routes/chapters.py:107) - so a
#     silencedetect gap is turned into a cue exactly the way achew itself
#     does it.
#   - `REALIGN_PADDING_EXPANDED` (app.core.constants in achew) is
#     reproduced as a plain constant for the one place the algorithm reads
#     it (the skeleton pool's coverage-aware headroom, see SLACK above).
# The `ChapterAligner` class and every constant/method above the "Local
# shims" marker below are otherwise unchanged from upstream.
#
# See app/pipeline/chapters.py for how this project drives it: a single
# whole-file ffmpeg silencedetect pass feeds `align()`'s detected_cues, and
# `scanned_regions` is always the entire file - this pipeline can afford to
# scan a whole (already-transcoded) book up front, unlike achew's own
# interactive use, which windows detection around each reference timestamp
# for latency reasons. Passing the whole file as one scanned region means
# `expansion_needed` (see EXPANSION SIGNAL below) never has anything to
# fire for: there's no narrower window it could still need to widen.

"""Re-aligns a Chapter Reference's timestamps onto detected cues.

Uses a "skeleton fill" approach to chapter-cue alignment using **offset-invariant duration-shape
matching**, in three tiers:

1. SKELETON. Keep only the strongest ~N cues and align reference chapters to them by matching
   the *unadjusted reference durations* to the spacings between cues (a monotonic duration-shape
   DP). Matching relative spacing rather than absolute position makes it immune to a global
   front-matter offset and to per-chapter slop; prefiltering to strong cues removes the bulk of
   the decoy silences (e.g. the louder pause after a chapter title). The pool depth is
   coverage-aware (see SLACK): a narrow scan gets a shallower strong set, which measurably
   reduces decoy flips. The chapters that land are placed reliably and establish accurate LOCAL
   positions. This is the confident tier. The duration term needs a time-base scale; the global
   book/reference duration ratio is used first, then revised to the robust slope through the
   skeleton's own matches when the two disagree (see SCALE_REVISION_MIN_DELTA) — the ratio
   mis-scales when the duration difference sits in trailing/front content rather than spread
   across chapters, which would otherwise make the skeleton drift later with every chapter.

2. FILL. The skeleton leaves runs of chapters unmatched — weak-gap true boundaries that never
   made the strong set, and (crucially) true boundaries that sit off the global scale line behind
   a regional front-matter/step offset, which the skeleton's position prior penalises into being
   skipped. Recover each such run with a *second, local* duration-shape DP over the FULL cue set,
   bracketed by the confident skeleton positions around it. Anchoring on real bracket times
   absorbs the regional offset, and running the match locally lets duration-shape carry the chain
   across a step inside the hole — a single global pass cannot. Its duration term runs on a scale
   read off the bracketing skeleton anchors, not the global duration ratio: a long final chapter
   (or trailing content) skews the global ratio, which an unbracketed *tail* run would accumulate.
   Fills are flagged as guesses.

3. POLISH. The local DP fixes the SHAPE of a run but can leave it a couple of seconds off, parked
   on a parallel decoy chain that is equally spacing-consistent (a tie only position breaks). With
   every chapter now placed, re-snap each guess bracketed on BOTH sides to the cue nearest the
   position interpolated from its immediate placed neighbours, in a small window — fine enough to
   fix this drift, tight enough to leave genuinely step-shifted fills alone. An unbracketed tail is
   left to the fill (whose local scale already handles it), so polish never re-introduces drift.

Fills/polish only ever touch guesses; the confident skeleton tier is never moved, so the aligner
is never silently wrong on a recovered boundary. On the real fixtures (≤3min duration difference,
the design target) this scores ~97% of matchable chapters within 0.1s, the rest flagged rather
than confidently misplaced.

EXPANSION SIGNAL. Detection only covers the audio the pipeline extracted (± the extraction
padding around each reference timestamp), so a boundary that shifted beyond the padding —
typically offsetting insertions/removals that leave the total durations similar — is simply
invisible: no cue exists at it. When ``align`` is given the ``scanned_regions`` that detection
actually covered, it reports ``expansion_needed`` in the returned stats: True when some chapter
ended up placed on no cue at all AND part of the window the aligner would have searched for it
was never scanned. "We found nothing, but we never looked there" is not evidence the boundary
is missing, so the pipeline reacts by widening the extraction padding and re-running detection
and alignment once. A chapter whose searched window WAS fully scanned and still has no cue is a
genuinely missing boundary (e.g. two chapters narrated as one) — expansion cannot help it, so it
does not fire the signal by itself when its surroundings were densely covered. Known limit: a
shifted region whose every chapter gets captured by a decoy chain inside the scanned windows
leaves nothing unplaced and is undetectable post-hoc.
